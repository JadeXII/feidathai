<font size=\"2\">Strengthening Positive Elements but Never Assisting Negative Ones;<br />
Eliminating Pathogenic Factors but Never Hurting Constructive Essences;<br />
Facilitating Treatment Processes but Never Interfering with Bodily Functions.<br />
</font></font></p>

<p><font face=\"Arial\"><br />
<font size=\"2\">The theoretical basis of Chinese medicine is literally the philosophy rooted in balancing the bodily essence or life force called Chi, which contains both positive and negative elements. The variation of Chi significantly influences the occurrence of disease, its development and subsequent transformation. <br />
</font></font></p>
<p><font face=\"Arial\"><br />
<font size=\"2\">In facing the occurrence and development of immunity-related diseases, Chinese medical professionals argue that they are based on conflicts between positive and negative elements within human bodies. As the positive elements prevail, the human body may have better resistance to diseases, making illness less possible or even prevented. When the positive elements are insufficient, the natural consequence is the occurrence and development of illness. The essential aspect of treatment involves altering the balance of the relative potency between positive elements and negative constituents. As positive elements can be suitably invigorated, the negative constituents will surely be suppressed; then the ideal of strengthening the positive elements and eliminating pathogenic factors may subsequently be realized. While the bodily essence, i.e. Chi, shifts towards the positive direction, it virtually implies that the illness itself will eventually move towards full recovery.<br />
</font></font></p>
<p><font face=\"Arial\"><br />
<font size=\"2\">Based on the theoretical basis of strengthening positive elements and eliminating pathogenic factors, clinically, we need to first observe the progression of growth and decline of positive elements and negative constituents. Consequently, we will prioritize the treatments according to their relative significances in association with the illness, then utilizing these relevancies accordingly. &ldquo;Strengthening positive elements only&rdquo; is the treatment most suitable for sick persons whose physical conditions are extremely weak. On the other hand, &ldquo;eliminating pathogenic factors only&rdquo; is the most feasible measure for patients whose illnesses are exceptionally awful. For most people whose positive elements are insufficient and pathogenic factors are already activated, we need to employ measures of strengthening positive elements and eliminating pathogenic factors&nbsp;</font></font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Arial\">simultaneously. It is the same logic as in conducting offensive and defensive maneuvers at the same time. Inevitably, we first need to identify whether the positive elements have the leverage or the pathogenic factors prevail. We should adopt strengthening positive elements as the main measure in coordination with eliminating pathogenic factors while the positive elements have the leverage. Alternatively, eliminating pathogenic factors should be the core approach, assisted by the strengthening of the positive elements as the pathogenic factors dominate the illness condition. Nonetheless, the directing principle is simply &ldquo;strengthening positive elements but never assisting negative constituents, as well as eliminating pathogenic factors but never hurting constructive essences&rdquo;.<br />

A. Strengthening Positive Elements --</strong></font></p>
<p><font face=\"Arial\"><br />
<font size=\"2\">Positive elements, also known as positive Chi, are the realization of the human ability to resist illness. It is fundamentally the strength that sustains physical health and can also be viewed as the performance of normal human body functions. From the perspective of modern medical science, it is a composite of illness resistance, natural recovery ability from disease and environmental adaptability of the human body. It is particularly noted that insufficient positive elements may lead to the onset of disease. This is the gist of the argument of &ldquo;helping the positive elements that may exclude the interference of pathogenic factors&rdquo;. In other words, there will be no possibility for the external pathogenic factors to interfere with the human body so that disease may result, when the positive elements within the human body are sufficient.</font></font></p>
<p><font face=\"Arial\"><br />
<font size=\"2\">Strengthening Positive Elements includes measures such as medication therapy, nutrition, physical exercise and other appropriate means to strengthen positive elements, thereby enhancing the bodily essence, elevating disease resistance and enhancing the ability to restore health. With these elements, we may successfully suppress pathogenic factors, defeat all of the dynamics that may cause illness and restore the health of our body. For those diseases caused by insufficient positive elements, we will treat them with &ldquo;supplementing positive elements to tackle insufficiency&rdquo; according to the teachings noted in the medical masterpiece &ldquo;Nei Jing&rdquo; (Yellow Emperor\'s Internal Canon of Medicine). Strengthening the positive elements basically will employ &ldquo;nutrition&rdquo; as the core approach according to various clinical conditions and the quality of individual bodies. There are several common prescriptions, such as facilitating positive elements, supplementing blood ingredients, nourishing femininity, enhancing masculinity, etc.&nbsp;<br />

It is the most effective and safe anti-cancer measure, with no side effects whatsoever. There are three features in the comprehensive effectiveness summary of the Tien Hsien Liquid listed as follows which may reflect the function of strengthening positive elements:</font></p>
<p><font face=\"Arial\"><br />
<font size=\"2\">1. Enhancing Immunomodulation Function<br />
2. Enhancing Regulation of Physiological Functions<br />
3. Reducing Side Effects of Radiation and Chemotherapy</font></font></p>
<p><font face=\"Arial\"><strong><font size=\"3\"><br />
B. Eliminating Pathogenic Factors</font></strong> </font></p>
<p><font face=\"Arial\"><br />
<font size=\"2\">Pathogenic factors, also known as pathogenic Chi, include the bacterial, viral, physical and chemical dynamics that may cause disease and relative pathological transformations. It is quite natural that &ldquo;the bodily essence becomes inferior when the pathogenic factors accumulate to a certain level&rdquo;. All factors that may cause illness will first be resisted and excluded by our own disease resistance ability. When resistance ability becomes insufficient, then disease may easily result. This is what is defined by Chinese traditional medicine as: &ldquo;when pathogenic factors prevail, disease is easily affected.&rdquo;</font></font></p>
<p><font face=\"Arial\"><br />
<font size=\"2\">Eliminating Pathogenic Factors includes measures such as medication, acupuncture, massage, exercise and other suitable means to eliminate pathogenic factors and confine the development of disease; by eliminating pathogenic factors, we may achieve the aim of strengthening positive elements and reducing negative constituents, thereby facilitating a gradual recovery from illness. Measures adopted for eliminating pathogenic factors are in the &ldquo;offensive&rdquo; category of traditional Chinese medication therapy. Various measures such as circulating blood, stimulating sweat, dissolving phlegm, clearing heat, detoxification, dissipation, excreting waste and other proper skills are commonly employed according to the individual situation and category of illness in clinical practices. There are eight features in the comprehensive effectiveness summary of the Tien Hsien Liquid listed below which may affect the function of eliminating pathogenic factors:<br />
&nbsp;</font></font></p>
<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Arial\">1. Awakening the Tumor Suppressor Gene by Epigenetic Modification<br />
2. Inducing Cancer to become Benign by Differentiation Induction<br />
3. Inducing Cancer Apoptosis by Apoptosis Induction<br />
4. Inhibiting Cancer Growth &amp; Promoting Apoptosis by Cell Cycle Regulation<br />
5. Confining Cancer Protein Activity by Signal Transduction Inhibition<br />
6. Resisting Cancer Invasion and Metastasis <br />
7. Treatment by Anti-Angiogenesis<br />
8. Eliminating Cancer Stem Cells to Circumvent Cancer Recurrence</font></p>

C. Facilitating Treatment Processes</strong></font><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<font size=\"2\">Determining how to improve the effectiveness of conventional radiation and chemotherapy, while reducing the cancer cells&rsquo; drug resistance to chemotherapy, is a persistent bottleneck in cancer therapy. Traditional Chinese medicine provides vital adjuvant therapy and promotes scientific validation of the relevant data so that integrating oriental and occidental medicine to &ldquo;separate the wheat from the chaff&rdquo;; elevating the effectiveness of the synthesized therapeutic measures is the moral obligation of all professionals involved in medical practice and studies. Driven by such conviction, the Tien Hsien Liquid may not only have the effect of strengthening positive elements and eliminating pathogenic factors constantly addressed by traditional Chinese medication, but also cope with the demands of modern medical therapy, verified by scientific researches, that it can reduce the cancer cells&rsquo; drug resistance by increasing their sensitization to radiation and chemotherapy. Hence, it may facilitate all regular treatment processes but never meddle with the processes themselves. There is only one feature noted in the comprehensive effectiveness summary of the Tien Hsien Liquid that is shown here that may reflect the function of facilitating therapy processes:<br />
