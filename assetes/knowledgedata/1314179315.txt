<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Arial\">The global megatrend of cancer treatment has advanced to a new phase called Complementary Alternative Medicine (CAM). Apart from surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, it also emphasizes how to enhance the patients&rsquo; strength and increasing the cancer cells&rsquo; sensitization to radiation and chemotherapy, thus weakening their drug resistance to reduce the side effects caused by regular medical treatments. Such measures may avoid the metastasis and recurrence of the cancer cells that will determine whether or not the patient may reach full recovery.<br />

In 1991, the Tien Hsien Liquid was formally listed in the global market. However, it did elicit distrust and misunderstanding due to undeniably flaws such as a lack of experimental data or insufficient credible evidentiary support in the field of science and medicine. Nevertheless, we appreciate the kindly assistance offered by those internationally renowned hospitals and medical schools that may preclude the existing prejudices and difficulties in conducting cell, animal and eventual clinical experiments for the Tien Hsien Liquid started from 1999 so that the Tien Hsien Liquid may have the opportunity to validate its capacity as a measure of complementary alternative medicine. As of July 2011, there have been more than twenty research projects, eight papers in internationally formally accredited medical journals, more than fifteen international medical conferences and the result of one clinical trial to support the effectiveness of Tien Hsien Liquid. It is indeed an unprecedented achievement and record in the history of developing traditional Chinese compound medication.</font></p>

<font size=\"2\">With the philosophy of &ldquo;strengthening positive elements but never assisting negative constituents; eliminating pathogenic factors but never hurting constructive essences; and facilitating treatment processes but never interfering with bodily functions,&rdquo; as well as other bases of pharmacological and scientific researches, Tien Hsien Liquid has established a basic framework and model for developing all Chinese medicines. Also, with such a powerful framework and model, we may successfully integrate oriental and occidental medicine and medications, and discuss their compatibility, cooperation and utilization, thus creating the trend of the new generation of pharmaceutical development. It may provide all patients with better treatments, considerably improving their quality of life and index of continuing survival.<br />
